## â„¹ What is Hover Animations?
Hover Animations is a collection of CSS styles. 

Hover Animations are all about simplicity. All animations are made using single element, together with the help of their pseudo-elements (```::before``` and ```::after```). No SVG and complex CSS involved. All CSS codes are provided on click, so you can easily copy and paste them.

***Disclaimer***. *The CSS animations may not be supported in older browsers. It is advisable to provide fallback values when applying.*

## âš™ How to Use
Since the CSS for all the animations can be easily found in the [demo](https://haikhalfakhreez.github.io/Hover-Animations/), it is recommended to just simply copy and paste the code directly.

### A. Copy and Paste
For example, if you want to get the Glow Around effect:

1. Find the Glow Around effect/animation. Can be found in the [demo](https://haikhalfakhreez.github.io/Hover-Animations/).
2. Click on it to open a pop-up window with its CSS. For example:

    ```css
    .glow-around {
        background: #fff;
        transition: box-shadow 0.3s;
    }
    .glow-around:hover, .glow-around:focus, .glow-around:active {
        box-shadow: 0 0 10px #aaa !important;
    }
    ```
3. Copy the code and paste it in your own styesheet.
4. In the HTML, add the specified class.

    ```html
    <a href="#" class="glow-around">My Button</a>
    ```

***Please note that in order for the animation to take an effect, make sure your element is*** ```block``` ***or*** ```inline-block```. ***The CSS given does not include basic element style such as*** ```border```, ```height```, ```width```, ```padding```, ***etc. It serves to be an inspiration / guide for you to use and make it your own.***

Happy styling!
